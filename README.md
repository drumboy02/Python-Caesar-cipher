# Python Simple Programs

These are my scripts for Section 5 of the Cisco NetAcad Python Essentials 2
course.

improving_caesar_cipher.py prompts the user for a string and a shift key and
returns the encoded text.

palindromes.py prompts the user for text, checks whether it is a palindrome
or not and returns the result.

anagrams.py prompts the user for two strings and checkes whether they are 
anagrams or not and returns the result.

digit_of_life.py asks the user to enter their birthday in a specific format,
sums all the digits and repeats until it returns exactly one digit.

find_a_word.py prompts the user for a string and a hidden word to search the 
string for and returns the result.
